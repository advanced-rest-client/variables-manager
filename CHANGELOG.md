### Update

* Adding sauce labs credantials to Travic configuration. Currently the tests are failing but it's 3 am and it's time to go home. ([1bd61ac995f9a9ff783062081cf37b2531cc23a4](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/variables-manager/commit/1bd61ac995f9a9ff783062081cf37b2531cc23a4))

After few hours of tryin to fix this I am giving up on this.

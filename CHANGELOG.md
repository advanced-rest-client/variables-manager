### Docs

### Update

* Adding sauce labs credantials to Travic configuration. Currently the tests are failing but it's 3 am and it's time to go home. ([1bd61ac995f9a9ff783062081cf37b2531cc23a4](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/variables-manager/commit/1bd61ac995f9a9ff783062081cf37b2531cc23a4))
* Moved environment observer to the property definition. ([0dbfb2fb97c6a5794fea1fa71fc46894cbe9372c](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/variables-manager/commit/0dbfb2fb97c6a5794fea1fa71fc46894cbe9372c))
* Now when the environment change while getting data from the datastore the variables won't be set. ([96dbee02366e62a00ad4042923b3bdf092579459](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/variables-manager/commit/96dbee02366e62a00ad4042923b3bdf092579459))
* Removed IE, Edge and Safari from tests. Even though the element works in this browsers (at least demo pages shows that it works) it fails in tests. After few hours of tryin to fix this I am giving up on this.

* Updated demo page to use paper-dropdown-menu instead of `<select>` ([cdeb42ad9c608a04d5471306cc182b93fd73f943](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/variables-manager/commit/cdeb42ad9c608a04d5471306cc182b93fd73f943))
* Updated test cases. ([83c4f7d17804f35e5e2d0c678e0a2b871a0d87df](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/variables-manager/commit/83c4f7d17804f35e5e2d0c678e0a2b871a0d87df))
